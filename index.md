## What makes a movie successful?
Is it the script, the director, or could it be the actor at the helm? We all know that actors are an essential part of a movie, but what actually is the recipe for success? Don't worry, we're here to answer all these questions and much more, so just scroll on! üëá

## A brief introduction
Movies are not like books. They are rarely solitary tasks and often involve large productions. They cannot spawn purely from the imagination and creativity of individuals. For movies to come to life, real human beings must play out a script given to them. They are part of the heart and soul of the production, and without these actors and actresses, there is no movie. This is why it's so essential to study the lead actors starring in a movie when evaluating its critical and commercial success.

## Wait, What Are We Even Looking At Here?
To analyze movies, we need reliable and representative data about them. In this project, we rely on multiple movie databases to explore the relationship between actor characteristics and movie success: the CMU dataset, the IMDb non-commercial dataset and a TMDb Kaggle dataset. You can find all descriptions in the [resources page](/ada-2024-project-authenticdataaddicts/resources/)! To make it short, these datasets give us insights about movies title, genre, release date, runtime, box office and ratings, as well as valuable informations about cast information such as actors and actresses' age, gender or ethnicity.

As we said above, what often plays a crucial role in a movie is the cast, in particular the lead actors. They will be an essential part of our project, so its important for you to know how we find them! One of the IMDb dataset allows us to extract the cast members that have the first and second role, this is what we will refer to as lead actors!

Our first question was "What makes a movie successful?". But what do we mean by success? ü§î Here, we will use two measures: box office performance (i.e. revenue generated by the movie) and critical reception (i.e. ratings from spectators). Indeed, high-grossing movies may not always be well-received and vice versa, so separating performance from reception could yield new insight.

One last technicality is adjusting the box office for inflation. This step is essential to ensure that movies from different time periods are compared fairly, as there may be economic changes over the years. We used the US inflation rates as a measure for this standardization, to convert the box office revenue in 2012 US dollars. For this, a dataset from the US Bureau of Labor Inflation Statistics was used, the description can be found at the [resources page](/ada-2024-project-authenticdataaddicts/resources/).


## Meet Gertrude: Breaking the Mold üçø
At 75 years old, Gertrude has always dreamed of being an actress. "Why not?" she says. "If there is one thing I've learned in these 75 years, is that the only way to achieve your dreams is to try!" Hey, casting directors, who knows, maybe Gertrude really will be the secret sauce for your next multi-million-dollar movie! If not, she'll at least provide amazing cookies. 


## Behind the Scenes: Let's Take a Quick Tour of the Movies üìΩÔ∏è
First, let's take the time to tour our movies! Sorry Gertrude, we have to put you on hold for now. In the plots below, we can see the runtime, box office and release date distributions of our movies. Please note that we only took feature-length movies, i.e movies with a runtime of at least 60 minutes. 
Below we can visualize histograms of the runtime, box office and release date distributions.

<iframe src="assets/plots/movies_numeric_features.html" width="750px" height="720px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

That's neat! We see that most of the movies have a runtime around 100 minutes, which is actually quite short! The movies on our datasets performed quite well in terms of box-office. The vast majority of them are also quite recent, which motivates why we now adjust the box office with the inflation. 

On the left, we show the average box offices for only the top 10 movies of the year, and on the right for all of them.
<iframe src="assets/plots/inflation_with_regression.html" width="750px" height="530px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
Let's try to understand theses graphs. For the top 10 movies, we see a clear trend (in both adjusted and unadjusted box office) that the average revenue becomes higher among the years.
This means recent hit movies have a better commercial success than older hit movies. We also note that this trend can be seen but at a much smaller scale for the unadjusted box office of all movies. 
However, the adjusted revenue shows a different trend for them. 

Now let's dive a little deeper into components of a movie, such as its genre, language, and country of production. Feel free to take a look at the beautiful bar chart below if that sounds interesting. 

<iframe src="assets/plots/genres_count.html" width="750px" height="450px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

Wow, it looks like the three most common genres are drama, comedy and thriller... how profoundly unsuprising! Good news though, Gertrude loves thrillers! Maybe one day she will get to star in her own... Anyway, let's see if there are any suprises in terms of production countries or languages.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px;">
  <iframe src="assets/plots/language_count.html" width="375" height="450px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  <iframe src="assets/plots/countries_count.html" width="375" height="450px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

Nope, none at all. As we could expect, the most common language by far is English and the two most common countries are the US and the UK. We see that French and France are also well represented in our dataset, coming right after. Getrude lives in the US and speaks English, no problems in sight! 

All these movies produced, from so many countries and in so many languages, but are they any good? Well, let's check out this histogram plotting the ratings and number of votes of the movies we're studying:

<iframe src="assets/plots/ratings.html" width="750px" height="450px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

Quite impressive actually! A median rating of 6.4 with on average of 60651 votes! Looks like there are a lot of high quality movies out there. 

But how does the rating change with respect to the country of movie?
We use propensity score matching to measure the effect a country has on the average rating.

<iframe src="assets/plots/matching_country_rating.html" width="750px" height="450px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

Ohhh, that's interesting! Movies in Spain have on average more than 0.6 rating points more than movies from other countries.
Gertrude, I hope your listening carefully, maybe you should go to Spain üá™üá∏ to star in the most loved movies.

## Stars of the Show: It's Time to Explore the Leading Cast! üí´
Now that we perused the movies, let's dive into their cast! Hang on tight, it's going to be a long (but worthwhile) ride as we explore their physical and demographic characteristics. 

<iframe src="assets/plots/pie_actor_ethnicity.html" width="750" height="550px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

You can see that African Americans are 20.4% of all actors in movies, whereas they only represent 14.4% of the leading cast. The percentages in the leading cast are also not even in the top 10 for White People and Indians, whereas they feature in the top 10 for all actors. German Americans go from not even being included in the all actors pie chart, to 5.42% in the lead actors pie chart. Wow, Meryl Streep doing the heavy lifting! These disparities are most likely due to a combination of casting bias, but also it is possible that we do not have much information on leading actors in Indian movies, for example. All this looks like good news for Gertrude. She is of German descent, so she might just score that sweet, sweet leading role! 

The news is not so good for Gertrude when we look at gender. Whether in leading roles or in all roles, men represent about two thirds of all actors. Pretty sure in the general population it's 50/50, just saying... 
<iframe src="assets/plots/pie_actor_gender.html" width="750" height="550px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

Hang in there, we're almost done with this part! Finally, here are the distributions of some physical characteristics of the cast, with a comparison between lead actors and all actors:
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px;">
  <iframe src="assets/plots/age_actor_lead.html" width="300" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  <iframe src="assets/plots/height_actor_lead.html" width="450" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>
For both age and height, we see that the trend among the lead actors is quite similar to the trend among all actors. Actors on young but not too young, tall but not too tall... [mettre la diff homme/femme].

Sure, Gertrude is on the older side, but that will just make her even more special, promise! 

## Does the Genre Change the Game? Let‚Äôs Find Out! üé¨
--> talk about the distribution of genres, and then do these studies but by genre

There are all types of movies, we saw that the most common are drama and comedy, but do the genres make a difference in terms of success? That's what we'll study now!
Let's look at the adjusted bow office depending on the genres.
<iframe src="assets/plots/adjBO_vs_genres.html" width="750px" height="450px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

This looks good!
But we didn't account for a lot of possible confounding variables influencing our results.
To avoid this, we use propensity score matching. üòÉ 
For each genre we matched movies of this genre movies with similar characteristic of another genre.
Then, we can compare the average effect (ATE) this genre has on the adjusted box office revenue and on the average rating.
For technical reasons we didn't use the box office itself but the log of the box office.

<iframe src="assets/plots/matching_genre_revenue.html" width="750px" height="450px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

Woow, this is interesting! 
Now we can see that Romance and Relationship is the genre which has on average the highest effect on the adjusted box office revenue.
Maybe Gertrude should consider participating in a Romance or Relationship movie. I'm sure this would suit her well. üòä

## Box Office Hit or Critics' Darling? Can a Movie Have It All? üéûÔ∏è
--> to be good or to be successful 

Now let's review the same plot as before, but instead of measuring the average effect a genre has on the box office revenue, let's see the effect on the average rating.

<iframe src="assets/plots/matching_genre_rating.html" width="750px" height="450px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

This changes the game!
The genre Romance and Relationship has now a slight negative effect on the average rating. üò¨
If Gertrude is hoping for a good review instead, she should do a Drama.

## The Final Cut: What Did We Uncover? üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Looks like a lead actor's physical and demographic characteristics really don't have that much of an effect on the success of a movie. There really is no one recipe to success! Maybe the secret sauce is just originality and breaking the mold. Producers, if that's what you want, Gertrude will be the perfect fit! 

--> summary and explain our key take aways
It's all the same! Take Gertrude!
