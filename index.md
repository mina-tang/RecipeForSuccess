## What makes a movie successful?
Is it the script, the director, or could it be the actor at the helm? We all know that actors are an essential part of a movie, but what actually is the recipe for success? Don't worry, we're here to answer all these questions and much more, so just scroll on! üëá

## A brief introduction
Movies are not like books. They are rarely solitary tasks and often involve large productions. They cannot spawn purely from the imagination and creativity of individuals. For movies to come to life, real human beings must play out a script given to them. They are part of the heart and soul of the production, and without these actors and actresses, there is no movie. This is why it's so essential to study the lead actors starring in a movie when evaluating its critical and commercial success.

## Wait, What Are We Even Looking At Here?
To analyze movies, we need reliable and representative data about them. We rely on multiple movie databases to explore the relationship between actor characteristics and movie success: the CMU dataset, the IMDb non-commercial dataset and a TMDb Kaggle dataset. You can find all descriptions in the [resources page](/ada-2024-project-authenticdataaddicts/resources/). To make it short, these datasets give us insights about movies title, genre, release date, runtime, box-office and ratings, as well as valuable informations about cast information such as actors and actresses' age, gender or ethnicity.

As said above, what often plays a crucial role in a movie is the cast, in particular the lead actors. They will be an important part of our project, so it's important for you to know how we found them. One of the IMDb dataset allows us to extract the cast members that have the first and second role. They are what we will refer to as lead actors.

Our first question was "What makes a movie successful?". But what do we mean by success? ü§î Here, we will use two measures: box-office performance (i.e. revenue generated by the movie) and critical reception (i.e. ratings from spectators). Indeed, high-grossing movies may not always be well-received and vice-versa, so separating performance from reception could yield new insights.

One last technicality is adjusting the box-office for inflation. This step is essential to ensure that movies from different time periods are compared fairly, as there may be economic changes over the years. We used the US inflation rates as a measure for this standardization, to convert the box-office revenue in 2012 US dollars. For this, a dataset from the US Bureau of Labor Inflation Statistics was used. The description can be found on the [resources page](/ada-2024-project-authenticdataaddicts/resources/).


## Meet Gertrude: Breaking the Mold üçø
At 75 years old, Gertrude has always dreamed of being an actress. "Why not?" she says. "If there is one thing I've learned in these 75 years, is that the only way to achieve your dreams is to try!" Hey, casting directors, who knows, maybe Gertrude really will be the secret sauce for your next multi-million-dollar movie! If not, she'll at least provide amazing cookies. 


## Behind the Scenes: Let's Take a Quick Tour of the Movies üìΩÔ∏è
First, let's take the time to tour our movies! Sorry Gertrude, we have to put you on hold for now. In the plots below, we can see the runtime, box-office and release date distributions of our movies. Please note that we only took feature-length movies, i.e., movies with a runtime of at least 60 minutes. 
Below we can visualize histograms of the runtime, box-office and release date distributions.

<iframe src="assets/plots/movies_numeric_features.html" width="750px" height="720px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

That's neat! We see that most of the movies have a runtime of around 100 minutes, which is actually quite short. The movies on our datasets performed quite well in terms of box-office, and are also quite recent.

On the left, we show the average box-offices for only the top 10 movies of the year, and on the right for all movies released in each year:
<iframe src="assets/plots/inflation_with_regression.html" width="750px" height="530px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>
Let's try to understand these graphs. For the top 10 movies, we see a clear trend (in both adjusted and unadjusted box-office revenue): the average revenue becomes higher as the years pass.
This means recent hit movies have a better commercial success than older hit movies. On the contrary, the adjusted box-office revenue for more modern movies is lower than for older movies. This is most likely due to a combination of factors: movies are easier to make than ever before, and unsuccessful older movies are probably lost to time and not included in our dataset. 

Now let's dive a little deeper into components of a movie, such as its genre, language, and country of production. Take a look at the beautiful bar chart below. 

<iframe src="assets/plots/genres_count.html" width="750px" height="450px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

Wow, it looks like the three most common genres are drama, comedy and thriller... how profoundly unsuprising! Good news though, Gertrude loves thrillers. Maybe one day she will get to star in her own... Anyway, let's see if there are any suprises in terms of production countries or languages.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px;">
  <iframe src="assets/plots/language_count.html" width="375" height="450px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  <iframe src="assets/plots/countries_count.html" width="375" height="450px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

Nope, none at all. As we could expect, the most common language by far is English and the two most common countries are the US and the UK. We see that French and France are also well represented in our dataset, coming right after. Getrude lives in the US and speaks English, no problems in sight! 

All these movies produced, from so many countries and in so many languages, but are they any good? Well, let's check out this histogram plotting the ratings and number of votes of the movies we're studying:

<iframe src="assets/plots/ratings.html" width="750px" height="500px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

Quite impressive actually! A median rating of 6.4 based on average on 60651 votes! Looks like there are a lot of high quality movies out there. 

## Stars of the Show: It's Time to Explore the Leading Cast! üí´
Now that we perused the movies, let's dive into their cast! Hang on tight, it's going to be a long (but worthwhile) ride as we explore their physical and demographic characteristics. 

<iframe src="assets/plots/pie_actor_ethnicity.html" width="750" height="550px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

You can see that African Americans represent 20.4% of all actors in movies, whereas they only represent 14.4% of the leading cast. The percentages in the leading cast for White People and Indians are also not even in the top 10, whereas they feature in the top 10 for all actors. German Americans go from not even being included in the all actors pie chart, to 5.42% in the lead actors pie chart. Wow, Meryl Streep doing the heavy lifting! These disparities are most likely due to a combination of casting bias, but also it is possible that we do not have much information on leading actors in Indian movies, for example. All this looks like good news for Gertrude. She is of German descent, so she might just score that sweet, sweet leading role! 

The news is not so good for Gertrude when we look at gender. Whether in leading roles or in all roles, men represent about two thirds of all actors. Pretty sure in the general population it's 50/50, just saying... 
<iframe src="assets/plots/pie_actor_gender.html" width="750" height="550px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

Hang in there, we're almost done with this part! Here are the distributions of some physical characteristics of the cast, with a comparison between male and female actors:
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px;">
  <iframe src="assets/plots/age_actor_lead.html" width="300" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  <iframe src="assets/plots/height_actor_lead.html" width="450" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

As expected, we see that the male actors are older and taller, whereas female actors are shorter and younger.
Sure, Gertrude is on the older side, but that will just make her even more special!

But honestly, does gender, height and age really makes a difference? 
We did propensity score matching on different age at release and height groups.
For each age at release and height group, we measure the average effect (ATE) on the rating and box-office revenue.

|                        |   ATE on average rating  |    ATE on log adjusted box-office |
|:-----------------------|-------------------------:|----------------------------------:|
| Gender                 |                  -0.0689 |                           +0.0124 |
| Height [1.52m, 1.73m]  |                  -0.0382 |                           -0.0058 |
| Height [1.73m, 1.80m]  |                  +0.0578 |                           -0.0158 |
| Height [1.80m, 2.16m]  |                  -0.0212 |                           -0.0175 |
| Age at release [ 8,26] |                  +0.0346 |                           -0.0055 |
| Age at release [26,30] |                  +0.0479 |                           -0.0148 |
| Age at release [30,35] |                  +0.0386 |                           -0.0285 |
| Age at release [35,40] |                  -0.0799 |                           -0.0015 |
| Age at release [40,48] |                  -0.0873 |                           -0.0041 |
| Age at release [48,86] |                  -0.0309 |                           -0.0434 |

Actually, none of the age nor height groups seem to have a signifiant impact on the average rating or box-office revenue.
So, Gertrude, believe in yourself and continue to follow your dream! ü§ó

## From Screen to Score: Does Country of Production Matter? üé¶
We saw earlier that movies had a median rating of 6.4, but is the country of production of a movie positively or negatively correlated with its rating? We use propensity score matching to measure the effect a country has on the average rating.

<iframe src="assets/plots/matching_country_rating.html" width="750px" height="450px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

Ohhh, that's interesting! Movies in Spain have on average about 0.5 rating points more than movies from other countries.
Gertrude, I hope you're listening carefully, maybe you should go to Spain üá™üá∏ to star in the most loved movies.


## Does the Genre Change the Game? Let's Find Out! üé¨

There are all types of movies ‚Äî we saw that the most common are drama and comedy ‚Äî but do the genres make a difference in terms of success? That's what we'll study now!
Let's look at the adjusted bow office depending on the genres.
<iframe src="assets/plots/adjBO_vs_genres.html" width="750px" height="450px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

This looks good!
But we didn't account for a lot of possible confounding variables influencing our results.
To avoid this, we use propensity score matching (again). üòÉ 
For each genre, we matched movies of this genre with movies with similar characteristic but of another genre.
Then, we can compare the average effect (ATE) this genre has on the adjusted box-office revenue and on the average rating.
For technical reasons we didn't use the box-office revenue itself but the log of the box-office revenue.

<iframe src="assets/plots/matching_genre_revenue.html" width="750px" height="450px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

Woow, this is interesting! 
Now we can see that Romance and Relationship is the genre which has on average the highest effect on the adjusted box-office revenue.
Maybe Gertrude should consider participating in a Romance or Relationship movie. I'm sure this would suit her well. üòä

## box-office Hit or Critics' Darling? Can a Movie Have It All? üéûÔ∏è

Now let's review the same plot as before, but instead of measuring the average effect a genre has on the box-office revenue, let's see the effect on the average rating.

<iframe src="assets/plots/matching_genre_rating.html" width="750px" height="450px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></iframe>

This changes the game!
The genre Romance and Relationship has now a slight negative effect on the average rating. üò¨
If Gertrude is hoping for a good review instead, she should do a Drama.

## The Final Cut: What Did We Uncover? üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
With all this precious information, Gertrude now holds the secrets to making a blockbuster hit. She's starting to think that being a director might suit her just as well as acting! ‚ú® And guess what? She can now harness the power of her very own "Movie Success Predictor" to predict the rating on her future movie. Curious? Gertrude can click [here](https://mina-tang.github.io/ada-2024-project-authenticdataaddicts/movie-prediction/) to dive in and start planning her next big hit! üé•üåü

Diving back into our analysis reveals one undeniable truth: there‚Äôs no magic formula for movie success, especially when it comes to lead actors.
It looks like a lead actor's physical and demographic characteristics really don't have that much of an effect on the success of a movie. 
Maybe the secret sauce is just originality and breaking the mold. Gertrude would be the perfect fit! 
We still uncovered some key takeaways:
- Modern movies dominates the box-office, even if older movies sometimes shine in adjusted revenue. A future movie may break all records - maybe Gertrude's!
- Genres like Romance seems to have a good commercial effect, while Drama excels in critics. Maybe combining those two genres will lead to the next hit movie!
- Actor characteristics have minimal impact - breaking the mold might be the winning ticket! Gertrude should still consider her actress career and star in her own movie. üòé

## And That's a Wrap! 
There is no universal formula, but a mix of creativity, boldness, and hard work should do the trick. It's time for Gertrude to take over Hollywood! üëè

Thanks for joining us through this cinematic journey, see you at the theaters! üé¨
