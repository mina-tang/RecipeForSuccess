## What makes a movie a successful?
Is it the script, the director, or could it be the actor at the helm? We all know that actors are an essential part of a movie, but what actually is the recipe for success? Don't worry, we're here to answer all these questions and much more, so just scroll on! ðŸ‘‡

## Introduction
Movies are not like books. They are rarely solitary tasks and often involve large productions. They cannot spawn purely from the imagination and creativity of individuals. For movies to come to life, real human beings must play out a script given to them. They are part of the heart and soul of the production, and without these actors and actresses, there is no movie. This is why it's so essential to study the lead actors starring in a movie when evaluating its critical and commercial success.
