## What makes a movie a successful?
Is it the script, the director, or could it be the actor at the helm? We all know that actors are an essential part of a movie, but what actually is the recipe for success? Don't worry, we're here to answer all these questions and much more, so just scroll on! ðŸ‘‡

## A brief introduction
Movies are not like books. They are rarely solitary tasks and often involve large productions. They cannot spawn purely from the imagination and creativity of individuals. For movies to come to life, real human beings must play out a script given to them. They are part of the heart and soul of the production, and without these actors and actresses, there is no movie. This is why it's so essential to study the lead actors starring in a movie when evaluating its critical and commercial success.

## Wait, What Are We Even Looking At Here?
To analyze movies, we need reliable and representative data about them. In this project, we rely on multiple movie databases to explore the relationship between actor characteristics and movie success: the CMU dataset, the IMDb non-commercial dataset and a TMDb Kaggle dataset. You can find all descriptions in the [resources page](/resources/)! To make it short, these datasets give us insights about movies title, genre, runtime, box office and ratings, as well as valuable informations about cast information such as characteristics of actors and actresses such as age, gender or ethnicity.

What often plays a crucial role in a movie is the cast, and in particular the lead actors. They will be an essential part of our project, so its important for you to know how we find them! One of the IMDb dataset allows us to extract the cast members that have the first and second role, this is what we will refer to as lead actors!
